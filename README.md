## The Project Brief

Study Budz is the result of the mid-term(Week 9) project set during the School of Code Bootcamp. We were given 1 week (Mon - Fri) to come up with a working product that relating to the brief. We were also required to give a 10-minute presentation of our project at the end of the week.

Our brief was "To improve the remote team building experience at the School of Code”

## Our app and it’s features

The problem we focused on was the amount of unrecognized help bootcampers were offering to each other. We wanted to create a platform that encourages the bootcamp community to offer additional lessons that might help other students with subjects they struggle with. The platform evolves around a badge system where students can earn badges for the amount of help they offer. We feel that this gamification feature will help to keep users motivated and engaged.

### Features 

- The user can post info on their study session in our database by filling out and completing the form
- The user can also view all current sessions saved on the database.
- There is also a simple but functional navigation bar that includes a link to the "How Study Budz Works" section. This section displays an example of our User's Personal profile page

### Ideation and Design

- After we spent a bit of time getting to know each other, we immediately began to write a manifesto. We decided that we would dedicate Monday to Planning, Tuesday to Thursday afternoon to building our app and the remaining time would be spent getting our presentation ready. We always tried to keep this timeline in mind when making decisions. 

- One of our team members is an avid A.I. enthusiast and so, for a bit of fun, we decided to ask openAI to “suggest 10 ideas to solve problems coding bootcampers may have” The answers were surprisingly good and we decided to run with one of them: “Find a study group or tutor - this will help you stay motivated and get help when you need it”.

- Following this, we created a questionnaire to gauge the interest bootcampers would have in an app like this, the results were very positive. We then went on to create some User Profiles and Personas, and then used the disney ideation methodology to help us figure out exactly what we wanted to do over the next few days.

- We then created a flowchart to log the user’s journey, thinking about what will the user do, click on, what databases do we need etc. This helped us to begin visualising the app and made the wireframing process much smoother.

- We then created a low-fidelity wireframe in Miro and a high-fidelity wireframe in Figma.

- Finally we tried to clarify our database structure and created a basic component tree.

## The Journey 
### What we learned, the challenges we faced and how we overcame them
- This was our first big project and the first time we had made a Full Stack Application. So, although we were happy with the outcome, many mistakes were made along the way. However, we felt that we learned from these mistakes and they helped to prepare us for the big final project a few weeks later. 

- We followed the Agile methodology throughout the project, with daily standups and retros. We really got along well and quickly created a psychologically safe environment to work in. This helped to keep us engaged and motivated throughout. We celebrated the small wins together, shared a few jokes and supported each other when we hit the brick walls. 

- The biggest problem we faced was trying to get the front and the back end to talk to each other.  We realised how important it is to plan and clarify data structure and key names before coding. After some head scratching and spikes in blood pressure, we realised that one of our object key names on the front end did not match the key name on the back end. Had we realised this earlier, we could have had more time to do some of the things we wanted such as stretch goals and testing etc. But hey, it’s all part of the learning process and it’s a mistake I’m sure we will be very hesitant to make again. We managed to solve this problem (and therefore create our first FullStack app!) with less than a minute to spare at the end of the day. Just enough time for us to celebrate and woop with joy! 

- Upon initial render, the data from the back-end can take a long time to load. However, we were able to solve this by adding a loading message with the help of a tutorial from the legendary NetNinja.

- We had some applying CSS to our site and got to play around with and thus deepen our knowledge of flexbox.

## Roadmap
Although we achieved our MVP goals, we only had 4 days to plan, design and make our App. Therefore there are a number of features that we were not able to implement. Below we detail some of the features we would have implemented if we had more time.

### Week 1

- Implement some unit tests and end-to-end testing
- Complete the Search for Sessions feature.
- Create Admin Dashboard
- Create account and login features (with Auth0)
- Implement basic badge system for users. (e.g badges for posting or attending sessions)

### Week 2

- Create algorithms to implement a deeper badge system; based on session numbers, feedback, rating etc.
